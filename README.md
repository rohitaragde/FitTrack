# Fitbit Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze data obtained from the Fitbit device of the user and provide valuable insights, correlations, and trends. By analyzing various aspects of health and fitness data, we seek to understand lifestyle impacts, sleep patterns, activity trends, and more.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Analysis for Health and Fitness Trends:** Analyze Fitbit data to identify trends related to health and fitness.
- **Lifestyle Impact Study:** Study the impact of lifestyle choices on health and fitness metrics.
- **Sleep and Activity Correlation Analysis:** Explore correlations between sleep patterns and activity levels.
- **Activity Patterns on Weekdays vs. Weekends:** Compare activity patterns between weekdays and weekends.

## Data Acquisition
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/singhakash/fitbit-dataset/data?select=FitBit+data.csv).
The dataset contains a total of 457 observations and 18 features. These features include various metrics collected from the Fitbit device, such as steps taken, heart rate, sleep duration, and activity levels.

## Data Preprocessing
Before conducting the analysis, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, standardizing data types, and any necessary feature engineering.

## Data Analysis
The main focus of this project is on data analysis to derive insights and patterns from the Fitbit data. Analysis techniques such as statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning may be employed to extract meaningful information from the data.

## Deliverables
- **Comprehensive Analysis Report:** A detailed report summarizing the findings, insights, and correlations discovered during the analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Interactive visualizations will be provided for stakeholder presentations, making it easier to communicate key insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
